<p>Upper Whittleton Arch<p>
<p>This arch doubles as a waterfall and along the trail has many boulders that can be assumed fell off from the original whittleton arch or something similar to it. The land sourrounding it has karst topography, and can be seen by the disappearing rivers and hole looking depressions in multiple rocks in the area.<p>
<p>The height I measured in ArcGIS is about 36.35ft, and is shaped like a a very tall arch with some lower cliff lines close by. However, the data was a little off because there are trees overhanging the arch and the surrounding clifflines so it is very hard to get very accurate data, although the height is very close to the actual height of the arch.<p>
