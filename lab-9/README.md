## Data files

We will use our existing maps and content from the previous labs.

* Custom maps of your park made ArcGIS Pro and Mapbox
* Photographs of your landform you made for your field trip
* A Python script or Jupyter Notebook showing some basic geoprocessing
* A animation of your landform using lidar data

## Templates

The pages you created in Labs 01 and 08 will serve as templates to add content.. Alternatively, you can create your own pages from scratch or use any of web design frameworks we discussed in lesson.

## Required specifications of the deliverable

The final submission must fulfill the following requirements:

* One index.html or readme.md page from lab 01 (introduction to the RRG) and should include
	* The requirements (updated from instructor's pull request) from lab 01
	* The base map from lab 05 (step 2)
	* A link to your Lab 08 map
	* A locator map (made in Lab 07 or from this lesson's hillshade) that shows the Red River Gorge in Kentucky
* One HTML page showing your updated Mapbox map (from Lab 08)
	* Photographs from Lab 05 (step 4)
	* Video animation and map of cliffs over 40ft from Lab 07
	* A two-paragraph narrative exploring your landforms character and environment
	* Basic measurements describing your feature's dimension, such as height, width, etc.

## Bonus (+3!)

* Add a link to a Jupyter Notebook that shows some of your Python programming power. The link should go to the `github.com` side to allow the notebook to render properly. Make sure you add a few comments or Markdown cells to explain what you are doing with the notebook.
